# Time of Your Life
This app is inspired by Rando Kim book, Time of Your Life.

The formula of this application assume that average human age is 80 years old. So if we compare it to 24 hours, then 80 years old is 24 hours and 40 years old is 12 hours which is exactly at noon. From here we could get the formula that one year is equal to 18 minutes. How about your age? What time is it? Don't worry, you don't need to calculate it. This application will help you. All you need to do is provide us your age and this application will calculate your time of life.

### Quote from the book
`
Every flower has its own blossom time: forsythia, Camellia, and the other flowers. Those flowers know when their seasons are coming; but most of us don’t, most of us struggling for being the first. Do you feel that you are left behind? Do you feel that you have been wasting your time while your friends are getting closer to their success? If you have had those thoughts, just remember that you have your own season, and your friends have it too. It’s not your time yet. But, it’s definitely coming your way. Maybe it seems too late, but just believe, when the time has came, you will blossom beautifully. So, head up and be prepare for your season. Remember, you are wonderful.
